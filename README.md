# 🧬 Breast Cancer Prediction

A machine learning project focused on predicting breast cancer diagnoses using patient data. This model supports early detection and clinical decision-making by analyzing key diagnostic features.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a breast cancer prediction system. The model is trained on a dataset with features commonly used in medical diagnostics to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

## 📊 Dataset Features

Typical features include:
- Radius mean
- Texture mean
- Perimeter mean
- Area mean
- Smoothness mean
- Compactness mean
- Concavity mean
- Symmetry mean
- Fractal dimension mean
- Diagnosis label (Benign/Malignant)

> Be sure to preprocess the dataset: handle missing values, normalize features, and encode labels.

## 🧠 Model Training

The notebook walks through:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest
- Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## 📈 Results

The trained model demonstrates high accuracy and effective classification performance. Visualizations help interpret feature importance and model behavior.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KardamSinghal/BreastCancer.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   cd BreastCancer
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to follow the workflow.
